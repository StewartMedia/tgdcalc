**Trade Glass Depot – Glass Fence Calculator & UX/UI Project Proposal**

Prepared by: StewArt Media

Date: 22 October 2025

Valid for 30 Days

---

## **1\) Executive Summary**

We propose delivering a private embedded Shopify calculator for TradeGlassDepot.com.au (TGD) that streamlines quoting and purchasing for Inline, L-shape, and Closed Rectangle glass fence runs. Customers will enter mm measurements and receive a safety-compliant, itemised bill of materials (BOM) with live pricing and one-click cart integration. This will significantly reduce quoting time, minimise errors, and improve conversion.

The investment starts from **AUD $19,500 ex GST** and includes three fence shapes with BOM logic, pricing integration, and cart functionality. Timeline: 4–5 months. Additional UX/UI enhancements are outlined below as standalone projects.
