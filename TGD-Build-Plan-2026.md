# TGD Build Plan 2026
**Client No.1** | Trade Glass Depot

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Owner:** Jim Stewart
**Status:** Awaiting Nick's revised quote (overdue from Feb 4)

---

## Strategic Decision (Feb 5)

**Build a private, standalone Shopify app for TGD. Not a SaaS product.**

**Why:**
- TGD is paying $19.5k+ for development - unfair for competitors to get it for $99/month
- Client relationship matters more than speculative SaaS revenue
- Keep focus on Skaw as the primary product launch
- Market research validated the opportunity exists - can revisit SaaS later if desired

**What TGD gets:**
- Exclusive glass fence calculator for their store
- Full ownership of the solution they paid for
- Ongoing support option ($450/month)

**What StewArt gets:**
- $19.5k+ project revenue (awaiting Nick's revised quote)
- Learnings and IP that inform future product thinking
- Strengthened TGD relationship (transformation roadmap pipeline)
